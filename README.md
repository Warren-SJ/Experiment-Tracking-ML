# Experiment-Tracking-ML
This is a repository for experiment tracking using tensorboard. Pytorch was used for creating models and pre-existing models were tested and compared on various datasets for image classification.

Additionally, a custom built ViT is also implemented which can be used for experiment tracking as well.
